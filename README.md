# Babysitter_Kata
An app to calculate a babysitter's nightly charge

First Feature: Calculate total pay, based on babysitter start and end time, and a family.

First Unit test: Family A pays $15/hr before 11pm, and $20/hr the rest of the night
		 We will test for a night of babysitting from 7:00pm-10:00pm for family A
